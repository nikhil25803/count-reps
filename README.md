### Count Reps

A customizable computer vision application that helps you track and count the reps during the exercises like sit-ups, push-ups, dumble presses, and other exercises. With the support of a database, you can even keep a track of your data.

By default, the application is programmed to count the number of knee bends, useful in ortho exercise. 

### Run the program
```bash
python main.py
```
A window will appear at first as a test, close that for now by pressing `q`, and then the database will automatically get connected (you'll notice, a `database db` file is now created in the root directory of the project) which is responsible for storing a user's data. It will keep counting your reps and will store them in the database once it quits.
